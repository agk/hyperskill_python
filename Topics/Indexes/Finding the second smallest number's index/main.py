# Define a function that takes an input string and outputs an integer
def index_of_second_smallest(input_string):
    # input_string is a string of integers separated by spaces
    # You can convert the string into a list of integers using the following line
    list_of_integers = list(map(int, input_string.split()))

    # Your task is to find the index of the second smallest number in the list
    # If the second smallest number does not exist, return -1
    # Write your algorithm here

# Don't forget to call your function with an input string to test it!'
