The code provided attempts to achieve this, but it has a scope issue.</p><p>As it stands, this code will raise an error because the variable <code class="java">user_city</code> is not accessible outside the <code class="java">change_city</code> function.</p><p>Add exactly one line of code inside the <code class="java">change_city</code> function to fix this scope issue. The line should be added where the comment indicates.
